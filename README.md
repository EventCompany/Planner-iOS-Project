# Planner-iOS-Project

# Scope
Right now to keep things very simple for a MVP this serves two basic functions:

Provide a database and user friendly interface for inventorying and funding current and future projects. This is meant to replace quickly outdated spreadsheets and diagrams.

Provide a means of getting updated to the projects that are currently happening or are in planning phases that we care about
